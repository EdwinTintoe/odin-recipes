    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic pasta dish with traditional tomato sauce. Simple but excellent.</p>
    <p>You can use the sauce as a base for other pasta dishes, as well as a pizza sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Celery</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Chopped tomatoes or roasted tomatoes if you're feeling fancy</li>
        <li>Chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>Basil (can be rosemary or thyme)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>White pepper</li>
        <li>Mozarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up olive oil in a sauce pan.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onion, carrot, garlic, and celery, and saute until caramelised.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes to the pot. Chopped tomatoes are fine, but nothing beats fresh tomatoes, which have been halved and oven-roasted with basil or rosemary.</li>
        <li>Add stock, herbs and seasoning, and simmer until carrots are soft. You might need to top up the stock as it evaporates in the process to get the right consistency.</li>
        <li>In another pot, bring water and salt to boil, and cook your favourite pasta al dente.</li>
        <li>When the carrots are cooked, blend the sauce to a smooth consistency with a blender.</li>
        <li>Strain the pasta but leave a bit of water in, and throw it in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Coat the pasta fully with sauce, add mozarella, and serve with fresh basil leaf.</li>
       </ol>
    <p>Bon apetit!</p>
